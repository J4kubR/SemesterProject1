# Semester Project 1
The Project was about implementing an electrical circuit for sharpening a pen and developing an matemathica wolfram algorithm for a painting machine. 
This was done in a group of 4 people where I was mainly responsible for the algorithm part.
This zipfile contains the datasheets for all of our used components. The pdf files have been named according to the components.
In addition to this, we have also included our code as an .nb-file and as pdf document.
Enjoy !
